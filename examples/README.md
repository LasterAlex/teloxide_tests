# Teloxide tests examples
To run them, firstly create a .env file like .example.env

### hello_world

A simple bot that sends Hello World! and introduces to the bot testing, telling how to test anything.

### calculator_bot

A little harder bot that shows the sintactic sugar for testing, and how to work with persistent state storage (using redis, but changing to InMemStorage is possible and easy).

### file_download_bot

Bot that shows how to download files from the server and test it.

### album_bot

Bot that tests the album sending and sending multiple updates at once.

### phrase_bot

The biggest bot, a bot that adds reactions, similar to some chat bots. Not particularly made to show some features, more like battle testing the crate and showing, how i will use this crate.

The tests are in the same files as handlers.

To run it you need to set up diesel for database.

1. You need to install and start postgres on your machine, here is [ubuntu install](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart)
2. `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres`
3. Add `~/.cargo/bin` to `PATH` (or just run ~/.cargo/bin/diesel by itself)
4. `diesel setup --database-url postgres://postgres:password@localhost/phrase_bot` in the phrase_bot directory (don't forget to change the password!)
5. `cargo run` or `cargo test`!

Fun fact: I did not run the bot until i've written everything! The tests really helped!
