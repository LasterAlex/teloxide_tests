# Teloxide tests

I am trying to make tests for teloxide using fake server and a bot with an url to that server.

Basic dataset is done, now of concern is a fake server.

## Todo

- [ ] Add dataset of all needed structs
    - [x] Add dataset of chats
    - [x] Add dataset of common messages
    - [ ] Add dataset of queries (low priority)
    - [ ] Add dataset of messages (low priority)
    - [ ] Add structs without a category (low priority)
- [ ] Add fake server
    - [ ] Add most common endpoints
    - [ ] Add tests
    - [ ] Add all common messages (low priority)
    - [ ] Add all queries (low priority)
    - [ ] Add all messages (super low priority)
    - [ ] Add everything else (may never be done)
- [ ] Make mocked bot that sends requests to fake server
- [ ] Make it into a library
