# Teloxide tests

I am trying to make tests for teloxide using fake server and a bot with an url to that server.

Basic dataset is done, now of concern is a fake server.

I am going right now by the following steps:

1) Make it work
2) Make it beautiful for the user
3) Make it beautiful on the inside

## Todo

- [x] Add dataset
    - [x] Add dataset of chats
    - [x] Add dataset of common messages
    - [ ] Add dataset of queries (low priority)
    - [ ] Add dataset of messages (low priority)
    - [ ] Add structs without a category (low priority)
- [x] Add fake server
    - [ ] Add most common endpoints
    - [ ] Add tests
    - [ ] Add all common messages (low priority)
    - [ ] Add all queries (low priority)
    - [ ] Add all messages (super low priority)
    - [ ] Add everything else (may never be done)
- [x] Make mocked bot that sends requests to fake server
- [x] Make it into a library
- [ ] Publish it when it is ready
